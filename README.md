## Description
Our JavaScript-based project transforms viewers into interactive particle systems via webcam input, tracking movement to create an immersive, surreal experience. Whether on a laptop or projected, it uses a narrative with 4 distinct particle-based artworks. Inspired by artists like Yayoi Kusama, the visuals may require a seizure warning.
